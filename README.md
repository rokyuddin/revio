# Revio: AI-Powered Customer Intelligence

**Revio** is a premium analytical platform designed to transform raw customer feedback into strategic business growth. It leverages advanced AI to distill thousands of reviews into clear, actionable insights in seconds.

## 🚀 Product Brief

### The Problem
*   **Data Exhaustion:** Modern businesses are flooded with reviews across multiple platforms (Amazon, Trustpilot, Google), making manual analysis impossible.
*   **Surface-Level Metrics:** Star ratings provide a score but fail to explain the "why." Critical friction points and hidden delights are often buried in qualitative text.
*   **Operational Lag:** By the time a human identifies a trend in feedback, the damage (or opportunity) is often outdated.

### The Solution: How Revio Works
1.  **Seamless Ingestion:** Effortlessly import feedback via direct text pasting or CSV uploads from major marketplaces like Amazon, Google, and Trustpilot.
2.  **Llama-Powered Analysis:** Our engine leverages high-speed Large Language Models (LLMs) via Groq to synthesize emotional sentiment, identify recurring themes, and extract feature-specific mentions.
3.  **Insight Dashboard:** A high-fidelity interface that visualizes "Strengths," "Frictions," and "Sentiment Velocity" at a glance with sub-second processing.
4.  **AI Action Center:** Beyond analysis, Revio provides a prioritized list of strategic suggestions to improve product-market fit, marketing hooks, and support workflows.
5.  **Historical Archiving:** Track how your customer sentiment evolves over time with persistent analysis history for long-term growth comparison.
